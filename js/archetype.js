                    <div class="column">He could ask for a human-like frame and
                    visage that, while not completely lifelike, is certainly close enough for most folks’
                    comfort. He could wind up with a form which could even walk the streets of most
                    Coalition cities and pass well enough to get by. He could…if he had a bank account the
                    size of many pre-Rifts® small nations. Instead, he got a massive combat frame
                    with huge metal plates, cables intertwining here and there, and the capacity to knock
                    a tank over. All that remains is a human face, tongue, and throat—or an idealized
                    synthetic duplicate—shielded behind an inhuman faceplate mounted to an armored
                    skull. He has this new body either because that’s what his sponsor paid for, or because
                    he actually wanted to be a living tank to begin with. He abandons all pretense of
                    natural life to become something much more powerful.
                    He does not necessarily abandon his humanity. That’s still a matter of choice.</div>

                    <div class="column">In an age of high-tech horrors and
                    supernatural monstrosities, a world beset 
                    by constant disaster might be utterly lost
                    without the hope given it by those who
                    stand in its defense. None epitomize this
                    idea more openly and spectacularly than the
                    psi-sword-wielding Cyber-Knights.
                    Take any noble warrior tradition—steeped
                    in matters of honor, justice, and mercy—and
                    it is a valid model upon which a Cyber-
                    Knight may base his life. Though most tend
                    to walk a path founded on the romantic
                    ideals of Western Europe (especially as
                    imagined for the heroic knights of legend),
                    there are Cyber-Knights representative of
                    almost any culture known on Earth, as well
                    as more than a few from places far, far away.
                    The foundations are simple yet inviolate
                    for those who gain the gifts of the calling.
                    Sadly, in the wake of the Fall of Tolkeen
                    (a terrible event that split the Order of the
                    Cyber-Knights nearly in half (see page 10),
                    there are plenty of those fallen from the path,
                    yet no less dangerous for it.</div>

                    Glitter Boy pilot lives under. Most try to live up to it, some fail, and a rare few never even
                    try, using the power of the suit to become tyrants and thieves. Those who uphold the heroic
                    tradition come from a long line of Glitter Boy pilots, earning the iconic power
                    armor suit from a previous owner (a parent, mentor, or friend). They grow up
                    hearing the stories of how the Glitter Boys, created and blessed by the superheroic
                    Neemans, strode forth into the fiery storms to save what they could of humanity. As
                    the dragons and demons and machines of terror poured forth from the Rifts to
                    destroy or enslave what remained of the human species, the Glitter Boys stood alone
                    for long years to hold back the tide of total apocalypse.
                    Eventually, allies stood beside them, including the Cyber-Knights and others
                    with the power to make a difference. The collective consciousness of humanity,
                    however, never forgets their current existence is thanks to those 10-foot-tall,
                    glittering suits of godlike armor.</div>

                    <div class="column">Life is not cheap. But many of those going
                    under the knife for the bio-comp and other
                    implants to convert them into the most
                    potent super-soldiers in the world might
                    think it is. They often spout nihilistic
                    phrases like, “Live fast, die young, and leave
                    a great-looking corpse!” Most of them might
                    even mean it at the time.
                    Inevitably, they come to understand
                    differently as their short years pass by in
                    a haze of bullets and blood, and their lives
                    burn away faster and faster.
                    A Juicer sells his most precious commodity—
                    his very existence on the planet—for the gifts
                    of chemical enhancement through nanotech
                    augmentation, all managed and moderated
                    by an internal bio-comp system. Speed,
                    strength, and endurance 10 times that of a
                    top athlete make a Juicer a powerful combat
                    machine. He trades his natural lifespan to
                    become a killing machine, rented to the
                    highest bidder or committed to an ideal that
                    matters more than his own life.
                    In many cases, he does it just to see that
                    his family gets a decent, safe place to live
                    and three square meals a day.
                    Whatever the reason, the Juicer is a
                    powerful and dangerous being for a few
                    short years at best, and then he’s either dead
                    or (in very, very rare cases) a shattered husk
                    of a person yearning for glory forever lost.</div>

                    junctions, and classic vehicles soaring the
                    skies as much by will as by wire—these
                    are the defining joys of the Techno-Wizard.
                    He loves machines, but he loves the magic
                    potential of machines even more, and he’s
                    dedicated his life to fulfilling that potential
                    wherever he can.
                    Techno-Wizards see the quest for renewable
                    energy sources as long over. The solution flows
                    all around them in naturally occurring power conduits
                    crisscrossing the planet, surging through nexuses
                    and Rifts like giant transformers and junction boxes.
                    Magic is the ultimate in broadcast power,
                    and the great ancient wizard, Tesla, would be very
                    proud of what they’ve done with it so far.</div>
