                    visage that, while not completely lifelike, is certainly close enough for most folks’</br>
                    comfort. He could wind up with a form which could even walk the streets of most</br>
                    Coalition cities and pass well enough to get by. He could…if he had a bank account the</br>
                    size of many pre-Rifts® small nations. Instead, he got a massive combat frame</br>
                    with huge metal plates, cables intertwining here and there, and the capacity to knock</br>
                    a tank over. All that remains is a human face, tongue, and throat—or an idealized</br>
                    synthetic duplicate—shielded behind an inhuman faceplate mounted to an armored</br>
                    skull. He has this new body either because that’s what his sponsor paid for, or because</br>
                    he actually wanted to be a living tank to begin with. He abandons all pretense of</br>
                    natural life to become something much more powerful.</br>
                    He does not necessarily abandon his humanity. That’s still a matter of choice.</div>

                    Take any noble warrior tradition—steeped</br>
                    in matters of honor, justice, and mercy—and</br>
                    it is a valid model upon which a Cyber-</br>
                    Knight may base his life. Though most tend</br>
                    to walk a path founded on the romantic</br>
                    ideals of Western Europe (especially as</br>
                    imagined for the heroic knights of legend),</br>

                    Cyber-Knights nearly in half (see page 10),</br>

                    hearing the stories of how the Glitter Boys, created and blessed by the superheroic</br>

                    destroy or enslave what remained of the human species, the Glitter Boys stood alone</br>
                    for long years to hold back the tide of total apocalypse.</br>
                    Eventually, allies stood beside them, including the Cyber-Knights and others</br>

                    a great-looking corpse!” Most of them might</br>
                    even mean it at the time.</br>
                    Inevitably, they come to understand</br>

                    machine. He trades his natural lifespan to</br>
                    become a killing machine, rented to the</br>
                    highest bidder or committed to an ideal that</br>
                    matters more than his own life.</br>
                    In many cases, he does it just to see that</br>

                    and three square meals a day.</br>
                    Whatever the reason, the Juicer is a</br>
